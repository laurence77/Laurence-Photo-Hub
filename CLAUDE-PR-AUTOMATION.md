# Implement specific feedback
claude "implement the changes requested by the reviewer in comment #3"

## Integration with GitHub

### Prerequisites
- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or download from https://cli.github.com/
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Install Claude Code (you already have this!)

### Repository Setup
The automation is already set up in this repository with:
- âœ… Helper scripts in `scripts/claude-pr.sh`
- âœ… npm commands in `package.json`
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow for notifications

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific with Claude
```bash
# Good
claude "fix the TypeScript errors in the UserProfile component and add proper type definitions"

# Better  
claude "the UserProfile component has these issues: missing props interface, any types, and no error handling. Please fix these specific problems"
```

### 2. Work Incrementally
```bash
# Instead of one big command, break it down:
npm run pr:review 123    # Review first
npm run pr:fix 123       # Then fix
npm run pr:test 123      # Add tests
npm run pr:docs 123      # Finally document
```

### 3. Review Claude's Changes
Always review what Claude changed before pushing:
```bash
git diff                 # See all changes
git add -p               # Stage changes selectively
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Permission Issues
```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/claude-pr.sh
```

### GitHub CLI Not Authenticated
```bash
gh auth login
gh auth status
```
